  #### QUICK TEST ####
  # This is a much quicker test run which only runs the unit tests against the low/medium/high
  # supported PHP versions and skips the PHAR test and the tests for external JS/CSS tooling.
  # These are basically the same builds as in the Test->Coverage workflow, but then without doing
  # the code-coverage.
