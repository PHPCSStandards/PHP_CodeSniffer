## [4.0.0beta1] - 2025-05-11

### Added
- Files without extension can now be scanned if the path is passed in directly. [#2916][sq-2916]
    - Previously, files without extension would always be ignored.
    - Now, files with no extension are checked if explicitly passed on the command line or specified in a ruleset.
    - Files without extension will still be ignored when scanning directories recursively.
- Support for extending a default value for an array property on a sniff from an XML ruleset file. [#15]
    - Previously, using `extend="true"` on an property tag for setting an array value could already _extend_ a property value set elsewhere in an (inluded) ruleset.
    - Now, you can also add to (extend) a default value as set on the sniff itself.
    - Note: the property default value and the values set via the ruleset will be merged.
        - This also means that for associative arrays, you can redefine the value for a particular array key.
        - For numerically indexed arrays, this means the array will be renumbered. Keep this in mind if the numeric indexes hold meaning.
- Added support for PHP 8.4 properties in interfaces to File::getMemberProperties(). [#2455][sq-2455]
    - Note: properties in interfaces is not fully supported yet, it is just this one method which handles them correctly at this moment.
- `Tokens::NAME_TOKENS` containing an array with the tokens used for identifier names. [#3041][sq-3041]
- New sniff `Generic.WhiteSpace.GotoTargetSpacing` to enforce no space between the label of a `goto` target and the colon following it. [#1026]
- An error message is now displayed if no files were checked during a run. [#1595][sq-1595]
    - This occurs when all of the specified files matched exclusion rules, or none matched filtering rules.
- An error will be shown when attempting to change an unchangable PHP ini setting using `-d option[=value]` or via the ruleset with `<ini name=...>`. [#416]
    - Previously, this was silently ignored.
    - Attempting to change non-existent ini settings (typo, extension not loaded) will continue to be silently ignored.

### Changed
- The minimum required PHP version has changed from 5.4.0 to 7.2.0.
- The default coding standard has changed from `PEAR` to `PSR12`.
- Both `phpcs` as well as `phpcbf` will now exit with exit code 0 if no issues were found/remain after fixing. [#184]
    - Non auto-fixable issues can be ignored for the exit code determination by setting the new `ignore_non_auto_fixable_on_exit` config flag to `1`.
    - For full details on the new exit codes, please refer to the Wiki ["Advanced Usage"](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Advanced-Usage#understanding-the-exit-codes) page.
- Composer installs no longer include any test files. [#1908][sq-1908]
    - The test framework files will still be included to allow for use by external standards.
- All status, debug, and progress output is now sent to STDERR instead of STDOUT. [#1612][sq-1612]
    - Only report output now goes through STDOUT. As a result of this, piping output to a file will now only include report output.
        - Pipe both STDERR and STDOUT to the same file to capture the entire output of the run.
    - The `--report-file` functionality remains untouched.
    - With this change in place, timing and memory consumption stats will now be displayed more often as this will no longer interfere with reports.
- The `--extensions` command line argument no longer accepts the tokenizer along with the extension. [#2448][sq-2448]
    - Previously, you would check `.module` files as PHP files using `--extensions=module/php`.
    - Now, you use `--extensions=module`.
- When processing rulesets, `<config>` directives will be applied based on the nesting level of the ruleset. [#2197][sq-2197]
    - Previously, it was not possible to overrule a `<config>` directive set in an included ruleset from the "root" ruleset.
    - Now, `<config>` directives set in the "root" ruleset will always "win" over directives in included rulesets.
    - When two included rulesets at the same nesting level both set the same directive, the value from the _last_ included ruleset "wins" (= same as before).
- When processing rulesets, `<arg>` directives will be applied based on the nesting level of the ruleset. [#2395][sq-2395], [#2597][sq-2597], [#2602][sq-2602]
    - Previously, it was not possible to overrule a `<arg>` directive set in an included ruleset from the "root" ruleset.
    - Now, `<arg>` directives set in the "root" ruleset will always "win" over directives in included rulesets.
    - When two included rulesets at the same nesting level both set the same directive, the value from the _first_ included ruleset "wins" (= same as before).
- Internal errors will no longer be suppressed when the `--sniffs` CLI argument is used. [#98]
- The `File::getDeclarationName()` method will no longer accept `T_ANON_CLASS` or `T_CLOSURE` tokens. [#3766][sq-3766]
    - A `RuntimeException` will be thrown if these tokens are passed.
- The `File::getDeclarationName()` method will now always return a string (or throw an Exception). [#1007]
    - Previously, the method would return `null` if the name could not be determined, like during live coding.
        Now it will return an empty string in those situations.
- The `File::getMemberProperties()` method will no longer add warnings about possible parse errors. [#2455][sq-2455]
    - This means the `Internal.ParseError.InterfaceHasMemberVar` and the `Internal.ParseError.EnumHasMemberVar` error codes have been removed.
    - The method will now throw a "$stackPtr is not a class member var" `RuntimeException` for properties declared in enums (parse error).
    - Properties declared in interfaces will be analyzed like all other properties, as these are allowed since PHP 8.4.
- None of the included sniffs will warn about possible parse errors any more. [#2455][sq-2455]
    - This improves the experience when the file is being checked inside an editor during live coding.
    - If you want to detect parse errors, use the `Generic.PHP.Syntax` sniff or a dedicated linter instead.
- The PEAR + PSR2 FunctionCallSignature sniffs will now also examine anonymous class instantiations with parameters. [#47]
- The error code `Squiz.Classes.ValidClassName.NotCamelCaps` has been changed to `Squiz.Classes.ValidClassName.NotPascalCase`. [#2046][sq-2046]
    - This reflects that the sniff is actually checking for `ClassName` and not `className`.
- The error code `Squiz.PHP.Heredoc.NotAllowed` has been replaced by `Squiz.PHP.Heredoc.HeredocNotAllowed` and `Squiz.PHP.Heredoc.NowdocNotAllowed`. [#2318][sq-2318]
    - This allows for forbidding either heredocs or nowdocs without forbidding both.
- The `PSR12.Files.FileHeader` sniff now has more modular error codes to allow for more selectively applying the rules. [#2729][sq-2729] [#3453][sq-3453]
    - The `PSR12.Files.FileHeader.SpacingAfterBlock` error code is replaced by:
        - `PSR12.Files.FileHeader.SpacingAfterTagBlock`
        - `PSR12.Files.FileHeader.SpacingAfterDocblockBlock`
        - `PSR12.Files.FileHeader.SpacingAfterDeclareBlock`
        - `PSR12.Files.FileHeader.SpacingAfterNamespaceBlock`
        - `PSR12.Files.FileHeader.SpacingAfterUseBlock`
        - `PSR12.Files.FileHeader.SpacingAfterUseFunctionBlock`
        - `PSR12.Files.FileHeader.SpacingAfterUseConstBlock`
    - The `PSR12.Files.FileHeader.SpacingInsideBlock` error code is replaced by:
        - `PSR12.Files.FileHeader.SpacingInsideUseBlock`
        - `PSR12.Files.FileHeader.SpacingInsideUseFunctionBlock`
        - `PSR12.Files.FileHeader.SpacingInsideUseConstBlock`
- The error code `Squiz.Commenting.VariableComment.TagNotAllowed` has been replaced by a dynamic `Squiz.Commenting.VariableComment.[TagName]TagNotAllowed` error code. [#1039]
    - This allows for selectively allowing specific tags by excluding the error code for that tag.
    - Example: to allow `@link` tags in property docblocks, exclude the `Squiz.Commenting.VariableComment.LinkTagNotAllowed` error code.
- The following sniffs have received performance related improvements:
    - PEAR.NamingConventions.ValidVariableName
    - PSR2.Classes.PropertyDeclaration
    - Squiz.Commenting.VariableComment
    - Squiz.Scope.MemberVarScope
    - Squiz.WhiteSpace.MemberVarSpacing
    - These sniffs will no longer listen to non-variable tokens, nor for variables tokens outside of OO context. [#374]
        External sniffs which extend one of these sniffs may need adjustment if they want to retain the old behaviour.
- PHPCS now uses the PHP >= 8.0 native method for tokenizing (namespaced) identifier names. [#3041][sq-3041]
    - Before PHP 8.0, PHP would tokenize namespaced names using `T_STRING` and `T_NS_SEPARATOR`.
    - From PHP 8.0, PHP uses the tokens `T_NAME_FULLY_QUALIFIED`, `T_NAME_RELATIVE`, and `T_NAME_QUALIFIED` instead.
    - PHPCS now uses these new PHP 8.0 tokens no matter what version of PHP is being used to run PHPCS.
    - Custom sniffs that use `T_STRING` and `T_NS_SEPARATOR` tokens to look for namespaced names will need to be modified.
    - The `Tokens::FUNCTION_NAME_TOKENS`/`Tokens::$functionNameTokens` array now includes the identifier name tokens.
- Closure T_USE tokens, T_ISSET, T_UNSET, T_EMPTY, T_EVAL and T_EXIT tokens now contain parenthesis information. [#23], [#2593][sq-2593]
    - Previously, you had to find the opening and closing parenthesis by looking forward through the token stack.
    - Now, you can use the `parenthesis_owner`, `parenthesis_opener` and `parenthesis_closer` array indexes.
- The `static` keyword when preceded by `instanceof` will now be tokenized (again) as `T_STATIC`. [#22]
    - Previously, the token was (re-)tokenized to `T_STRING`.
- `T_OPEN_TAG` tokens will no longer contain any whitespace. [#593]
    - Previously, "long" open tags could include either a single space or a new line character.
    - This whitespace will now be tokenized as a `T_WHITESPACE` token.
- `T_GOTO_LABEL` tokens will no longer include the colon following it. [#185]
    - The colon belonging with a goto label will now be tokenized separately as `T_GOTO_COLON`.
- Context sensitive keywords used as a label in a `goto` statement will now be tokenized as `T_STRING` to prevent confusing sniffs. [#185]
- All `T_DOC_COMMENT_*` tokens now have the `comment_opener` and `comment_closer` indexes set. [#484]
- The `Tokens::FUNCTION_NAME_TOKENS`/`Tokens::$functionNameTokens` array now includes the `T_ANON_CLASS` token. [#47]
- Type casting for sniff property values set from within a ruleset has been made more consistent. [#708]
    - `true` and `false` will now always be set to a boolean value, independently of the case in which the value was provided.
    - `null` will now be set to an actual `null` value. Previously, the sniff property would have been set to string `'null'`.
    - Array element values will now also get the type casting treatment. Previously, array values would always be strings.
- The `PHP_CodeSniffer\Config::setConfigData()` method is no longer static. [#2675][sq-2675]
    - The associated (`private`) `Config::$overriddenDefaults` property is also no longer static.
- The `PHP_CodeSniffer\Config::setSettings()` method is now a `void` method. [#1001]
- The signature of the `DummyFile::setErrorCounts()` method has changed and now expects the following parameters: `$errorCount, $warningCount, $fixableErrorCount, $fixableWarningCount, $fixedErrorCount, $fixedWarningCount`. [#1079]
- The `Generator` classes will now throw a `PHP_CodeSniffer\Exceptions\GeneratorException` when encountering errors in the documentation XML. [#1072]
- The `PHP_CodeSniffer\Generators\HTML::STYLESHEET`, `PHP_CodeSniffer\Util\Timing::MINUTE_IN_MS` and `PHP_CodeSniffer\Util\Timing::SECOND_IN_MS` class constants are no longer `public`. [#1051]
- The `PHP_CodeSniffer\Util\Timing` class is now `final` and marked as an internal class. [#1074]
- The Ruleset class no longer has special behaviour when used in a test context. [#996]
- The minimum required PHPUnit version for the test framework has changed from 4.0 to 8.0. [#994], [#997]
    - The test framework is now compatible with PHPUnit 8.x - 11.x (ignoring PHPUnit deprecations related to PHPUnit 12).
- The test framework has been refactored and no longer creates a custom test suite. [#25]
    - If tests for an external standard extend the PHPCS native test suite, be sure to read the upgrade guide for more detail.
- The two abstract base test cases have been renamed. [#25]
    - Replace `PHP_CodeSniffer\Tests\Standards\AbstractSniffUnitTest` with `PHP_CodeSniffer\Tests\Standards\AbstractSniffTestCase`.
    - Replace `PHP_CodeSniffer\Tests\Core\AbstractMethodUnitTest` with `PHP_CodeSniffer\Tests\Core\AbstractMethodTestCase`.
- Tests which extend the `AbstractSniffTestCase` for which no test case files (`.inc` files) can be found, will now be marked as "incomplete". [#998]
    - Previously, those tests would silently pass.
- All test case files (`inc`) which would be changed by the sniff under test if running the fixer, are now required to be accompanied by a `*.fixed` file. [#300]

    - Sniffs which are specifically aimed at CSS/JS files will no longer run.
    - All other sniffs will now treat all files under scan as PHP files.
    - The JS/CSS tokenizers and all tokens which were specifically for CSS/JS have also been removed.

### Fixed
- Fixed bug [#185] : goto labels were incorrectly tokenized as `T_STRING` if there was whitespace and/or comments between the label and colon.
- Fixed bug [#1012] : in edge cases, the tokenizer could create some stray `parenthesis_*` keys.
- Fixed bug [#1020] : File::findExtendedClassName() will no longer break on namespace relative class names.
- Fixed bug [#1020] : File::findImplementedInterfaceNames() will no longer break on namespace relative interface names.
- Fixed bug [#1020] : Various sniffs now have better support for ignoring/examining qualified function calls.
