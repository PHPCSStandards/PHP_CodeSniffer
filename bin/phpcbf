 * PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer fixes violations of a defined coding standard.
 *
 * :WARNING:
 *   This file MUST stay cross-version compatible with older PHP versions (min: PHP 5.3) to allow
 *   for the requirements check to work correctly.
 *
 *   The PHP 5.3 minimum is set as the previous PHPCS major (3.x) already had a PHP 5.4 minimum
 *   requirement and didn't take parse errors caused due to the use of namespaces into account
 *   in its requirements check, so running PHPCS 3.x on PHP < 5.3 would have failed with a parse
 *   error already anyway, so PHP 5.3 seems reasonable to keep as the minimum for this.
